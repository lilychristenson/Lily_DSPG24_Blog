In fall 2024, I will be a senior majoring in statistics and minoring in general business. I chose a statistics major because I have always enjoyed math, particularly statistics. I chose to minor in business because I believe it would be useful when working with companies. \n\n![](imgs/DesMoines.jpg){width=500 fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n### Plans\n- My plans are to get a job in data analytics/data science. Data science is important because it gives people and businesses valuable information and insight about data sets. Which in turn helps with decision-making. \n\n### Data Science\n- I have some prior data science knowledge from my previous statistics classes. I have learned how to analyze and make visuals from datasets using R. I also learned how to produce statistical outputs to help answer questions. \n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\nTable: Summary of Adverstising data\n\n|          |Min. |1st Qu. |Median |Mean   |3rd Qu. |Max. |\n|:---------|:----|:-------|:------|:------|:-------|:----|\n|TV        |1.0  |49.75   |97.50  |96.140 |143.25  |190  |\n|Newspaper |0.3  |12.75   |25.75  |30.554 |45.10   |114  |\n|Sales     |1.0  |31.75   |55.00  |58.370 |85.00   |121  |\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lily_Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lily_Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-2-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](Lily_Introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-4-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### Extracurriculars\n- Some extracurricular activities I enjoy are going to the gym, enjoying nature, playing with my dog, photography, watching movies and sports, and spending time with my friends and family.

When things get difficult, I don't give up and try multiple ways to solve the issue. I have good communication, collaboration, and listening skills. \n\n### Skills I want to Develop\n- Three skills I want to develop throughout DSPG are my coding and data analytics skills. I also want to learn how to use SQL and strengthen my skills in Python, and R. Some of my data science skills are analyzing statistical outputs and using R studio to make visualizations. I also am curious and believe that comes in handy with data science. \n\n### Why these skills are important\n- I am pursuing these skills because I believe data science is important work. I will become a better data scientist and strengthen my analytical skills. With these skills I will be able to use them in future jobs. It will give me the skills and knowledge needed to create insights for data. \n\n### Plan to build these skills\n- I plan to improve these skills by taking courses on datacamp to strengthen my knowledge in certain software. I also will work with my peers to work through problems. I also can utilize LinkedIn Learnings to learn more about different software.\n\n![](imgs/curiosity.jpg){width=370 fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n\n```{=html}\n<style>\nbody {\nbackground-color: #F0EDDA;\n}\n```\n\n\n:::\n::: {.column width=\"50%\"}\n![](imgs/Instruments.jpg){width=266 fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n::::\n\n![](imgs/Photo.jpg){width=280 fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n- Skills that I value and appreciate about myself are that I am a very hard worker.
